# cs313 Chat app

## How to run the chat app
Because this is a JavaFX program, we need the JavaFX SDK. We have not included this in our repository because the files are too large to add to github or gitlab.

### Step 1: Getting the JavaFX SDK setup:
1. Go to https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ and download the correct SDK (version 21.0.2) for your machine.
2. Unzip the file, open the unziped folder, open javafx-sdk-21.0.2, and copy the /lib folder into the home directory of the project, i.e. the /lib folder should be in the same directory as the /src folder.

### Step 2: Running the app
1. Set the working directory of your termial to the home directory of the project (where the Makefile is).
2. To run the program, run: 
> make run
